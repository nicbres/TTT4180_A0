\begin{abstract}
    This report provides a description of the setup used and a discussion of the results gathered during the 
    recording assignement for the Technical Acoustics course.
    It will describe the equipment used for this task and the environment in which the recording took place.
    Then the results are presented with a following discussion thereof.

\section{Recording Setup}
\subsection{Site}
    The site chosen for this assignment was the intersection by Studentersamfundet, with the main sound source
    being cars and traffic noise in general.
    % TODO insert coordinates as reference

    The microphone was setup pointing directly to the intersection, where to closest point of sound generation
    was roughly $4\textrm{m}$ away. Though some of the sounds recorded are from sources with a distance $30\textrm{m}$ and with 
    respect to the microphone.

    The recording took place on \date{Sunday, 12th September 2021} between \time{12:45} and \time{13:45}. The
    weather was overcast with a slight wind, around $11^\circ\textrm{C}$, and no precipation.
